LidSim is a lidar point cloud gathering and visualization simulator. It supports both flash and scanning lidar technologies, accounting for both angular and range errors, and is capable of simulating point clouds of moving objects. The program also incorporates some basic tracking capabilities, while also allowing for machine learning models to be added in the future. 


and allowing for easy 3D visualization of

Development of a lidar emulator. The inputs will be the lidar specifications and world objects. The outputs will be clouds of points 3D
